DESCRIPTION:Description: This event is 12 hours of meaningful education and experience. Participants will walk in the shoes of homeless in Springfield MO through a live homeless simulation. They will learn more about the vicious cycle of homelessness and the impact of mental health on the poor. By playing different games, we hope to relate the complexities of homelessness. After the educational portion of the event, participants will experience 6 hours of sleeping outside in a safe environment. The purpose of this event is to communicate and experience the complexities of homelessness in a unique, new way.\n\n\n---\nEvent exported from Teamup, www.teamup.com
