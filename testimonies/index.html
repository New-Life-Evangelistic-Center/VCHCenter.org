					<h3>Giving Glory To God</h3>
					<p>Testimony is one of the surest ways of growing faith in a community as well as giving the glory
						of our blessing to God. When the body of Christ shares in suffering or praise, they express God
						moving on earth. Paul states this nicely in 1 Corinthians 12:21-26. We are all one body and
						through testimony we know how to pray and praise. Read and watch how the Lord is working in our
						community.</p>

												<h1>Quinton and Rosemary</h1>
												<p>Quinton grew up in a toxic, hurtful family environment. At age 2 he
													was placed in the Missouri foster care system. After moving from
													house to house, he was finally adopted at 7. His adopted father was
													incredibly abusive and beat him daily for 8 years. At age 15,
													Quinton fought back and found himself in the juvenile court system.
													At that point he did his best to cut all ties to his adopted family.
													Rosemary had a similar family experience. Both of her parents abused
													drugs. She moved out and back into with her parents three times
													throughout her teen years. Her extended family were eventually one
													of the causes that made her homeless.
													Quinton and Rosemary have been together 10 years and have been
													married 4. Due to bad relations with family and abusing drugs, they
													found themselves on the streets of Springfield. They were homeless
													for a year and a half, during which time they found themselves in a
													perpetual state of moving from place to place. In March 2018,
													Quinton and Rosemary finally decided they'd had enough of that life
													style.
													After joining the program with NLEC, they have professed that they
													feel called to ministry for life. Both have grown so much
													spiritually and physically. They are thankful for what God has done
													in their lives and both recognize God's amazing providence. They
													want others, who may be going through the same trials, to see that
													it is possible to overcome these obstacles.
													"I love having a roof over my head, getting closer to God, and
													taking care of others. I am reading through the whole Bible for the
													first time, and that's been a huge help!" said Quinton.
													"I get to help others and I enjoy helping others out. I get to see
													my kids, and I can focus on making myself and my community better."
													said Rosemary</p>

												<h1>Janet Beggerly</h1>
												<p>&ldquo;James 2:14-17 is my passion! I have been helping at the Center
													for a year. I started slow, getting my feet wet by learning how
													things worked. And I love it.
													I have served meals, prepared meals, gifted items, but God's true
													purpose was getting to interact with the homeless who came daily to
													the Center. So many of them want to know someone cares. They love
													being prayed for, listened to, and asked about their day, their
													hopes for the future.
													There are people who come regularly, who have been coming for years.
													There are some who come for a while then don't come at all. That's
													the hardest part for me. But I know God is in charge and He is
													watching over all of them.
													These people are kind and caring and appreciative for anything we
													do. I won't say I always come with a great spirit. Life gets in my
													way too. But I have always left this center feeling blessed beyond
													measure! I have Christ's love for these people and I count my
													blessings for getting the honor to help them have a brighter day,
													hopefully showing them God's love. I believe so much in the
													scripture from Romans 12-6-8. We each have a gift from God. Find
													your gift, and come help!&rdquo;</p>
