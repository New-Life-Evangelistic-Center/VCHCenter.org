							<h3>We Provide These Essential Services</h3>
							<br><br>
								<img class="image custom" src="../images/thumb01.jpg" alt="Day Shelter">
								<b>Day Shelter</b>
								<p>Whether it's scorching heat, freezing rain or heavy snow the homeless are welcome to escape from inclement weather. Our mission is to provide a safe haven for homeless veterans and civilians who are forced to live on the streets. Our building is an established community where we strive to support our brothers and sisters in any way we can. We do this by accepting anyone no matter where they're at in life.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<img class="image custom" src="../images/thumb02.jpg" alt="Computer Access">
								<b>Computer Access</b>
								<p>We provide computers for job searching, housing information, connecting with family. Having the ability to acces the internet when living on the streets is vital to taking steps to help ones self. It's easy to lose a phone and not have any way to reach out to those that can help you most.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<img class="image custom" src="../images/thumb03.jpg" alt="Recieve Mail">
								<b>Recieve Mail</b>
								<p>A homeless individual can put our day shelter as their mailing address. This essential service helps men and women recieve important documents and other critical information. You cannot apply for a job, housing or federal benefits if you don't have an address. Then can send and receive mail Monday through Saturday throughout year.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<img class="image custom" src="../images/thumb04.jpg" alt="Lockers">
								<b>Lockers</b>
								<p>We provide a substantial amount of lockers for both men and women. This is an essential location where they can securely lock up personal items. One thing that most people don't think about is how hard it is to drag around all your possesions. Lockers are really hard to come by when you're homeless.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<img class="image custom" src="../images/thumb05.jpg" alt="Showers">
								<b>Showers</b>
								<p>We provide showers for men and women on a daily basis. Cleanliness is an important part of human dignity. When you become homeless, it's much harder to have a daily routine of cleanliness. Providing showers gives back a small protion of respect for yourself. There are places few and far between where a homeless man or woman can clean themselves in a proper way.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<img class="image custom" src="../images/thumb06.jpg" alt="Laundry">
								<b>Laundry</b>
								<p>The first judgement made on a person's character is based on the cleanliness and style of their clothes. Because this is part of a human nature, the homeless are often stigmatized for their dirty clothes. Having access to laundry servicces is really important for many reasons. A man or woan have a higher chance of getting a house or job if they look presentable during the interview. Having clean laundry also gives human dignity back to the homeless.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<img class="image custom" src="../images/thumb07.jpg" alt="Meals">
								<b>Meals</b>
								<p>We provide breakfast and lunch every Mondary through Friday, and lunch of Saturday and Sundays. Eating a free meal is not only encouraging for the homeless, but in some cases even lifesaving. As the only day shelter in Springfield, we consistently provide meals for those who don't have anything.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<img class="image custom" src="../images/thumb08.jpg" alt="Free Store">
								<b>Free Store</b>
								<p>Our facility provides a wide range of necessary care items for the homeless. We are only able to provide so much because of the constant gracious giving of local support. There is always a need for certain items in our free store. Please refer to the donate page for more information.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<img class="image custom" src="../images/thumb09.jpg" alt="Library">
								<b>Library</b>
								<p>We have a fairly large selection of books in a a secluded section of our building. This library is a free service that allows homeless to relax or learn from teh books donated. Books are an excellent way to learn a new skill, take your mind off other stresses or continue your education. This space is also a quiet place to pray or meet with other friends in private.</p>
