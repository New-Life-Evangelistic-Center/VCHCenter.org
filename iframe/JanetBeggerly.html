		<h1>Janet Beggerly</h1>
		<p>&ldquo;James 2:14-17 is my passion! I have been helping at the Center for a year. I started slow, getting my feet wet by learning how things worked. And I love it.
		I have served meals, prepared meals, donated items, but God's true purpose was getting to interact with the homeless who came daily to the Center. So many of them want to know someone cares. They love being prayed for, listened to, and asked about their day, their hopes for the future.
		There are people who come regularly, who have been coming for years. There are some who come for a while then don't come at all. That's the hardest part for me. But I know God is in charge and He is watching over all of them.
		These people are kind and caring and appreciative for anything we do. I won't say I always come with a great spirit. Life gets in my way too. But I have always left this center feeling blessed beyond measure! I have Christ's love for these people and I count my blessings for getting the honor to help them have a brighter day, hopefully showing them God's love. I believe so much in the scripture from Romans 12-6-8. We each have a gift from God. Find your gift, and come help!&rdquo;</p>
