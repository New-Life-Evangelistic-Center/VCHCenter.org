		<h1>Quinton and Rosemary</h1>
		<p>Quinton grew up in a toxic, hurtful family environment. At age 2 he was placed in the Missouri foster care system. After moving from house to house, he was finally adopted at 7. His adopted father was incredibly abusive and beat him daily for 8 years. At age 15, Quinton fought back and found himself in the juvenile court system. At that point he did his best to cut all ties to his adopted family.
		Rosemary had a similar family experience. Both of her parents abused drugs. She moved out and back into with her parents three times throughout her teen years. Her extended family were eventually one of the causes that made her homeless.
		Quinton and Rosemary have been together 10 years and have been married 4. Due to bad relations with family and abusing drugs, they found themselves on the streets of Springfield. They were homeless for a year and a half, during which time they found themselves in a perpetual state of moving from place to place. In March 2018, Quinton and Rosemary finally decided they'd had enough of that life style.
		After joining the program with NLEC, they have professed that they feel called to ministry for life. Both have grown so much spiritually and physically. They are thankful for what God has done in their lives and both recognize God's amazing providence. They want others, who may be going through the same trials, to see that it is possible to overcome these obstacles.
		"I love having a roof over my head, getting closer to God, and taking care of others. I am reading through the whole Bible for the first time, and that's been a huge help!" said Quinton.
		"I get to help others and I enjoy helping others out. I get to see my kids, and I can focus on making myself and my community better." said Rosemary</p>
