										The Final Judgment<br>
										31 “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.<br>
										32 Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.<br>
										33 And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left.<br>
										34 Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.<br>
										35 For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me,<br>
										36 I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’<br>
										37 Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?<br>
										38 And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you?<br>
										39 And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’<br>
										<span class="TextHighlight">40 And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’</span><br>
										41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.<br>
										42 For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink,<br>
										43 I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’<br>
										44 Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’<br>
										45 Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’<br>
										46 And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”</p>
