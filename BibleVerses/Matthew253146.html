			<h1>Matthew 25:31-46 ESV</h1>
			<p><sup>31</sup> <i>When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.</i> <br><sup>32</sup> <i>Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</i> <br><sup>33</sup> <i>And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left.</i> <br><sup>34</sup> <i>Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</i> <br><sup>35</sup> <i>For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me,</i> <br><sup>36</sup> <i>I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’</i> <br><sup>37</sup> <i>Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?</i> <br><sup>38</sup> <i>And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you?</i> <br><sup>39</sup> <i>And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’</i> <br><sup>40</sup> <mark><i>And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’</i></mark> <br><sup>41</sup> <i>“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</i> <br><sup>42</sup> <i>For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink,</i> <br><sup>43</sup> <i>I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’</i> <br><sup>44</sup> <i>Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’</i> <br><sup>45</sup> <i>Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’</i> <br><sup>46</sup> <i>And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.</i></p>
