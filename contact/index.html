								<h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
								<p>In 1972 New Life Evangelistic Center began doing homeless street outreach. Their mission was quite simple; spread the gossple while serving those most in need. The ministry started in a mobile van but quickly spread to something far more organized. Many people were receiving Christ as their Lord and Savior. Larry Rice was boldy paving the way for other ministries to serve the homeless. They purchased 1411 Locust in downtown Missouri which became their headquarters and television station. For decades NLEC has been the forefront activist for homeless rights in the state of Missouri.</p>

								<p>Hundreds of men and women have come to know Christ through the work of NLEC. They have consistently been pushing legislators to help the homeless  in several different locations throughout Missouri. The ministry has been doing this only through the constant grace and mercy by God our Father. They celebrated their 47 year of ministry in 2019. They continue to make a massive impact on the lives of thousands. Currently they reach the homeless on the streets of St. Louis by providing essential needs on a daily basis. Continued prayers for this ministry are greatly appreciated as we keep reaching the lost and forgotten.</p>

								<h4>More Than A Day Shelter</h4>
								<p>On August 11, 2008 NLEC opened the doors of the Veterans Coming Home Center. Originally, our mission was to serve homeless Veterans in the city of Springfield, MO. A fierce battle insued between Larry Rice and city officials as he fought to open an overnight shelter at 806 North Jefferson. Larry Rice was unsuccessful in opening an overnight shelter. The Veterans Coming Home Center became the largest day shelter in the city of Springfield. NLEC saw the need to open the doors to both Veterans and Civilians. Currently we provide much needed services to anywhere between 150 to 250 people a day. As a division NLEC we continue the work of the ministry here in Springfield. We are the only day shelter in the city and because of that the needs are great. Please continue to pray for the Veterans Coming Home Center as we change lives through the power of the Holy Spirit and support from devout Christians in our community.</p>
